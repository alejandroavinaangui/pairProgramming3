This application is a memory game that has logic up to having cards that have pairs. The logic is at the point where the cards flip when chosen. The app follows the mvvm 
guidlines where the model, view model , and view work together to have a cleaner set of code. The model has all the data and initilizers that are needed and the view 
model has the code that helps to get the model data and present it in a clean manner to the view using published variables and observed objects. There is also animation
incorporated as well.
